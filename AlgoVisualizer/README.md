### Project Description

The project is meant to visualize the different sorting Algorithms, and to know how these algorithms work.
I have used d3.js framework for these animations. 

### Project Structure

The animation code can be found at `js/graph.js` and the sorting Algorithms can be found at `js/sortingAlgorithm.js`.
